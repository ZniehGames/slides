# What's your usual Workflow ?

---

## New project

* Spend days thinking the perfect architecture
* Write tons of documentation

---

## Include a new feature into a project

* Read tons of documentation
* Cross your fingers for an updated docs
* Feel afraid to modify the current code
* Understand the current algorithms

---

## During Development

* Write the best algorithm ever
* Objects are strongly coupled
* Rely on the QA to find your bugs
* Code very difficult to test
* Automatic tests not always possible
* Write tests once you have the code
* Duplicated fonctionalities

---

## Deliver the project

* Rarely deliver what it was expected
* Perform a bunch of manual tests
* Expect user reports of crashes
* Work hard to fix the crashes
* Fix one bug and create two more
* Time to Market slow because of manual tests
* Most written documentation is outdated...
* Programmers are oracles of knowledge and bottlenecks of information.
