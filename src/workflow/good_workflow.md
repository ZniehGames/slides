# Sump up of the workflow

---

# New project

* Apply BDD approach
* Start to develop immediately

---

# Include a new feature into a project

* Feel confident to mess up the code
* Code is self-explanatory

---

# During Development

* Develop just the required stuff
* Write examples before modify your code
* Code is testable by default
* Only required edge cases are defined
* Prevent regression bugs
* Expect QA to thumbs up
* Code as your documentation

---

# Deliver the project

* Deliver what it was expected
* ... and go for a beer !

- Faster time to market (i.e., reduced cycle times and higher deploy rates)

- Increased quality (i.e., increased availability, increased change success rate, fewer failures, etc.)

- Increased organizational effectiveness (e.g., increased time spent on value adding activities vs. waste, increased amount of value being delivered to the customer).
