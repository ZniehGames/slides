# Problems

---

# Software is about people not 0 and 1

---

# Coding is not as hard as colaborating

---

# Listen to your customers and adapt quickly

---

# "Why should we write our tests first? Isn't that going to slow my development?"

---

# Anybody who thinks they can go faster by not writing tests is smoking some pretty serious shit.

#Presenter Notes

You're going to go slow because you won't be able to refactor.
It will get harder and harder to manage. And you will slow down.

You'll find it harder and harder to add new features. You will find more and more bugs accumulating.

---

# You code is so fragile you won't trust yourself, or anyone else, to modify it.

---

# There is no refactoring without tests. There is no testing without refactoring.

#Presenter Notes

Refactoring === Design phase

---

# Write your tests. Refactor your code. Keep things simple and clean.

---

# Agile without automated testing is like cinema without popcorn, pointless.

---

#Â But tests tell if the software works, not if it does what the customer wanted.
